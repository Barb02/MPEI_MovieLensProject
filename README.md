# MPEI_MovieLensProject

Project made for Probabilistic Methods for Informatics Engineering subject at University

Consists in an MATLAB interactive program that gives information about similar movies and users based on the data from the platform 
[MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) and the implementation of some similarity algorithms (MinHash, shingles) and a counting bloom filter.


Details about the proposed problem can be found in this [guide.](https://github.com/Barb02/MPEI_MovieLensProject/blob/main/pl4teste_guiao.pdf)
